Files are viewable in the "Master" branch.  Go to "src" and "main" to view the code

This software is for sale for $30 through my company, Code Crafters, LLC

It is Marching Band Drill writing software that allows show designers to create drill in 2D, and view it animated and synced to music in 2D or 3D. It also will print drill charts and/or coordinate charts.  Menu items link to my YouTube channel where there is a "how to" video, and also to a Facebook community. I have deleted all database connection settings from this code, so it is not runnable.  Executables are available at www.banddirectorsshare.com/QuickCharts.  PC and Mac versions exist on that page.

The software opens to a trial version, and you can purchase the full version from menu buttons within the software that link you to a web page with PayPal integration.  Paying gives you access to an unlock code, which I have also deleted from these files.

The actual product website is at www.banddirectorsshare.com/QuickCharts
